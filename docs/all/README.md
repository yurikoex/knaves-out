# Introduction

## Prelude

Humans seek power. Gaining power over others deemed lesser than themselves gives them an unadulterated thrill. But one can only gain so much power by themselves. The lords of the land were hungry for more power, and they learned that by utilizing the unique powers of their kingdom's courts, they could overpower any enemy they faced. Magics, weapons, armies, bloodshed, and war, all driven by the unquenchable thirst of humanity.

Once a kingdom is established, the court that rules it desires even more power. Domination of the entire known world is the true goal, and then one can be considered... a god? Becoming the god of all humans is the ultimate power. Someone must have it!

## The Game

Knaves Out pits each player against each other to dominate the world the Dominatri.

The world of Dominatri is created by all the players involved via the placement of each player's chess board. This world is now the battlefield for a miniature-esque war game where players attempt to defeat all other kingdom's castles or win by fulfilling quests to show that they are the dominant ruler of the world.

Progression in the game is fueled by cards in the form of a kingdom's court. A court is the unique combination of Knave (Jack), Queen, and King cards. Once assembled, the kingdoms begin to thrive and acquire unique abilities.

Each member of the court holds a certain amount of energy to perform actions each turn. It's up to each player to decide how much energy each court member recieves or spends each turn.

Once the kingdoms have built up and war is waging, players will use strategy utilizing court actions, kingdom actions, and battlefield tactics to win it all!

## The Pieces

Knaves Out was created using existing classic games combined in a new modern way. When the apocalypse comes, you will be glad you have a copy of these rules.

### The Games

-   Craps Dice(5 six sided)
-   French Playing Cards
-   Checkers
-   Chess

# Rules

## Setup

1. Each player must have a copy of all 4 games and have all game pieces accounted for before playing. Each player is encouraged to bring unique pieces to the game to help distinguish players and to show off their personalities.
2. All players roll all 5 dice. Highest total goes first. Ties need to be settled between the tied players however they decide.
3. To create the world of Dominatri, each player begins to place a Checkers/Chess board on the table, clockwise unless south of the equator. If in space or on a planetary body other than Earth, always go counter clockwise.
4. As players place each board, at least 3 squares must be adjacent to another board(s) already placed on the table.

![Setup](../_media/board_constraints.png 'Align boards to allow 3 squares to touch')

![Setup](../_media/world_setup.png 'Example 8 player world of Dominatri.')

5. Players continue to place the white king building with 4 black checkers under it.
6. Each player should shuffle their personal deck of cards.
7. Player with highest roll takes the first turn.

## Turn

Each player takes a turn following the same order described in setup.

### Basic Rules of a Turn

1. Shuffle discard with deck if desired.
2. Draw up to 10 cards in hand.
3. Take any of the following 4 steps in any order. 
    - Play any cards from hand face up on towers. (You may play cards at ANY time as many times as you want during your turn; after attacks, movement, actions, ect.)
    - Take only 1 allowed action, unless otherwise stated.
    - Move any number of pawns/unpawns (You may move as many times as you wish, equal to the pawn's strength. Unlike the other actions, you may move 2 or more different times in a turn, for example, moving a pawn forwards to attack, then moving backwards to get out of danger.)
    - Attack (Each pawn/unpawn may do 1 attack per turn)
4. If 10 cards in hand and no cards played this turn, you may discard hand.

## Courts

There are 3 towers of cards on the table in front of each player. Each tower is built on court cards. The basics of building towers is selecting a court to rule the kingdom. A court consists of a Knave(Jack), a Queen, and a King card. Depending on the combination of the court, different allowable actions are available to the player and the main strategy of Knaves Out.

![Setup](../_media/towers.png 'Typical layout')

> Play area layout.

### Knave

Knaves are the founding fathers of kingdoms. They are the first to power, then they gather and build everything around them more and more. When building a court, a player can only place a jack card face up as their first card. This becomes the foundation to the first tower.

**NOTE**: Knaves have no way to be replaced as the game progresses, unlike Kings/Queens. Choose your Knave suite/color very carefully!

#### Basic Knave Actions

### Court Type

After all 3 court cards are placed, the court acquires a _court type_ depending on the makeup of the court's suite and/or color.

## Playing Cards

As players are allowed to place cards face up, they must place them in order A, 2-10, J, Q, K, above each of the corresponding court cards and/or the Ace of Spades.

### Special Cards

Some cards have unique properties unlike ordinary and Court cards.

#### Joker Card

Play this card to search the deck for any card that can be played and play it. Leave the Joker card under the card.

If the joker is under a court card, the card is now tainted.

Tainted Effects:

| Card  | Effect                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Knave | **All Hail** Costs 3                                                                                               |
| Knave | **Build** All new buildings are now tainted                                                                        |
| Queen | **Poison** Roll 6 sided die, rolling 1 causes king to switch the cup, queen dies                                   |
| Queen | **Charm** Roll 6 sided die, rolling 1 causes pawn to not move but die, resurrect as an unpawn, and gain 1 checker. |
| King  | **Knight** Costs 3                                                                                                 |
| King  | _Evil King_ - Makes any unpawn succesfully attack with a die roll of 4-6                                           |

## Movement

Pawns can move any direction. They can move a number of spaces equal to the checkers under them plus one.

A pawn can go to sea for the cost of 1 checker. It can move to the sea in 1 movement, but cannot return to land until next turn.

When a pawn returns to land, they can choose any space on the map next to the sea.

## Pawns

Pawns are the soldiers of the kingdom. Each pawn represents a collection of military might that a kingdom owns.

A pawn can attack other adjacent or diagonal chess pieces on the board(s), including their own if you desired.

![Setup](../_media/attacking.png 'Chess pieces must touch to attack.')

> Chess pieces must touch to attack. 1 and 2 can attack each other but 3 cannot.

Each pawn can attack with 1 die at a time. To successfully attack a pawn must roll 5-6 on a six sided die.

A pawn can be boistered with various ways in the game. When boistered, a pawn could have up to 4 checker pieces under it.

Each checker gives the pawn +1 extra attack dice up to a max of 5 attack dice.

A pawn can move 1 space per turn in any direction, adjacent or diagonal.

Each checker gives the pawn +1 extra space it can move per turn.

If a pawn dies, remove it from the board.

You can never have more than 8 black pawns (unpawns) and 8 white pawns (pawns) in play at once.

### Unpawns

Unpawns are the undead monstrosities born from the church's dark magic. These vile creatures are just as powerful as a pawn is, and follow all the same basic rules as a pawn would (such as movement, the pawn rules listed above, the checker rules below, ect.), but aren't affected by pawn-specific moves.

## Checkers and Boistering

Checkers are used as indicators to show that a chess piece has been boistered (or improved)

A checker under a pawn means it has an extra damage dice, and extra movement, and an extra hit point.

A checker under a building means it has an extra hit point

Black checkers for buildings, max 12 deployed.

Red checkers for pawns, max 12 deployed.

## Building

There are eight buildings. Each building can take 1 damage before being destroyed. If a building is destroyed, remove it from the board.

When a building is built, it must be placed next to an existing building, adjacent or diagonal.

A building may only have a max of 4 checkers.

### Tainted Building

This building has been tainted by the corruption of humans or the unholy.

All pawns act as 1 less their strength next to a tainted building. Minimum strength of 1.

All unpawns spawned next to a tainted building gain an extra checker.

#### Rooks

A rook building is the barracks of the kingdom. It can train and produce troops.

If two rook buildings are in play, pawns produced by **Train** start with a checker.

[filename](../actions/rooks.md ':include')

#### Knights

Knight buildings are the defense of the kingdom. They typically protect the King building, using the terrain to their advantage.

If two knight buildings are in play, They attack with +1 die (max of 5 dice).

[filename](../actions/knights.md ':include')

#### Bishop

Bishop buildings are the guiding holy light of the kingdom. They inspire hope in the darkest of days.

If two bishop buildings are in play, you need a perfect 6 die roll to hit their **Blessing** targets.

[filename](../actions/bishops.md ':include')

## Winning

If all other players are defeated and you are alive, you win.

## Defeat

If your king building is destroyed, you are defeated.

## Advanced / Alternate Rules

### Starting with a court

If your group decides to use this rule, start the game with a Knave, Queen, and King already in play. You can optionally have the Joker cards in play under any of the court cards.

### Add fuel to the fire

If you wish, add A-3 to each tower to get right into the action!

## Towers

The Two Towers are "events" any player can call upon at any time during a game. These towers come with both a negative and positive effect, so choose carefully if and when you want to use them.

Each tower can only be used once per game, and once the towers are destroyed, their after effects happen. 

###  Ivory Tower

Once per game, The White Queen piece is placed, becoming the Ivory Tower with 10 checkers under it, sacrifice them from unused or boistered. The placement is determined by the player who activates it. The player will declare themselves the Chosen One, stating "The Gods have chosen me as the one true king." The tower is placed by the Chosen One, and any enemy can attack it freely. The Ivory tower will deal 1 damage to any pawn or unpawns that starts a movement on the board the Ivory tower is placed on, exluding the Chosen One's pawns/unpawns. If the tower is destroyed, the Chosen one dies and loses.

 - After effects: The board the Ivory Tower was placed on becomes an island, accessible only via seafaring.

### Dark Tower

Once per game, The Black Queen piece is placed, becoming the Dark Tower with 10 checkers under it, sacrifice them from unused or boistered. The placement is by the Chosen One's choice of enemy. The player will declare themselves the Chosen One, stating "The Gods have chosen me as the destroyer of evil." The tower is placed by the chosen enemy, and in the beginning of each of the Chosen One's turns, a checker is removed from the Dark Tower. If the tower reaches 0 checkers, the Chosen One dies. The chosen player must deal damage to the Dark Tower to destroy it. If the tower is destroyed, the chosen enemy dies and loses.

-   After effects: The board the Dark Tower was placed on becomes Cleansed Ground, doubling movement speed if you start your movement in the Cleansed Ground.

# Appendix

## Terms

### Adjacent

Two pieces on the board(s) with touching squares.

### Tower

An area above any of the court cards in which a player places cards face up in order from lowest to highest(aces low). These cards are the currency in which actions are paid. These cards must be discarded when spent.

### (X) Cards

When text says "2 Cards" it is referring to the current court card's tower. For example, if the Knave has A, 2, and 3 as its cards in play, then it discards the 3 and 2 card to pay the cost of the desired action.

### (X) Each

When text says "2 each" it is reffering to one of each court tower regardless of which towers you currently have. AOS adds 1 additional cost to each (X) each price.

### (X) Red/Black

When text calls for red or black cards, you cannot use the action unless you have those cards in that color. For example, if you want to use the ability **Luck** when in a black-colored court, you can spend 1 each if every card is black. If any of the cards are red, you cannot use the ability. The same goes for actions that call for red cards.

### Devour

An action that calls for devour X tower requires a full tower to be placed under the corresponding court card until the court card is discarded.

### Attack Dice

Attack dice equal the boistered checkers under a chess piece. Success is usually a roll of 5-6. The success can be modified by various actions and events.

### Unpawns

Unpawns are the dark versions of pawns that can be created through certain court actions. They function exactly the same as pawns but are not affected by pawn-specific moves such as the king card's **Knight** ability.
