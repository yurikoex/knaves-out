# Introduction

## Prelude

Man seeks power. Gaining power over others deemed lesser than themselves gives them an unadulterated thrill. But one can only gain so much power by themselves. As the lords of the land learn there is even more power to be had working together to control the pawns, these knaves gain even more inflallable self images. Land, slaves, taxes, kingdoms, and eventually war, all become the unquenchable thirst of man.

Once a kingdom is established, the court that rule need more. Domination of the entire known world is the true goal. Then one can be considered... a god? Becoming the god of all men is the ultimate power. Someone must have it!

## The Game

Knaves Out pits each player against each other to dominate the world the Dominatri.

A game starts out setting up the world of Dominatri by players placing their chess boards. This world is now the battlefield for a miniature-esque war game where players attempt to defeat all other kingdoms castles or win by fulfilling quests to show they are the dominate ruler of the world.

Progression in the game is fueled by cards in the form of a kingdoms court. A court is the unique combination of Knaves, Queens, Kings cards. Once assembled, the kingdoms begin to thrive.

Each member of the court holds so much energy to perform actions each turn. It's up to each player to decide how much energy each court member recieves or spends each turn.

Once the kingdoms have built up and war is waging, players will use strategy utilizing court actions, kingdom actions, and battlefield tactics to when it all!
