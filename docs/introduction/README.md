# Introduction

## Prelude

Humans seek power. Gaining power over others deemed lesser than themselves gives them an unadulterated thrill. But one can only gain so much power by themselves. The lords of the land were hungry for more power, and they learned that by utilizing the unique powers of their kingdom's courts, they could overpower any enemy they faced. Magics, weapons, armies, bloodshed, and war, all driven by the unquenchable thirst of humanity.

Once a kingdom is established, the court that rules it desires even more power. Domination of the entire known world is the true goal, and then one can be considered... a god? Becoming the god of all humans is the ultimate power. Someone must have it!

## The Game

Knaves Out pits each player against each other to dominate the world the Dominatri.

The world of Dominatri is created by all the players involved via the placement of each player's chess board. This world is now the battlefield for a miniature-esque war game where players attempt to defeat all other kingdom's castles or win by fulfilling quests to show that they are the dominant ruler of the world.

Progression in the game is fueled by cards in the form of a kingdom's court. A court is the unique combination of Knave (Jack), Queen, and King cards. Once assembled, the kingdoms begin to thrive and acquire unique abilities.

Each member of the court holds a certain amount of energy to perform actions each turn. It's up to each player to decide how much energy each court member recieves or spends each turn.

Once the kingdoms have built up and war is waging, players will use strategy utilizing court actions, kingdom actions, and battlefield tactics to win it all!

## The Pieces

Knaves Out was created using existing classic games combined in a new modern way. When the apocalypse comes, you will be glad you have a copy of these rules.
