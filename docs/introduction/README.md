# Introduction

## Prelude

Man seeks power. Gaining power over others deemed lesser than themselves gives them an unadulterated thrill. But one can only gain so much power by themselves. As the lords of the land learn there is even more power to be had working together to control the pawns, these knaves gain even more inflallable self images. Land, slaves, taxes, kingdoms, and eventually war, all become the unquenchable thirst of man. 

Once a kingdom is established, the court that rule need more. Domination of the entire known world is the true goal. Then one can be considered... a god? Becoming the god of all men is the ultimate power. Someone must have it!
