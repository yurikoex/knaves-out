## Terms

### Adjacent

Two pieces on the board(s) with touching squares.

### Tower

An area above any of the court cards in which a player places cards face up in order from lowest to highest(aces low). These cards are the currency in which actions are paid. These cards must be discarded when spent.

### (X) Cards

When text says "2 Cards" it is referring to the current court card's tower. For example, if the Knave has A, 2, and 3 as its cards in play, then it discards the 3 and 2 card to pay the cost of the desired action.

### (X) Each

When text says "2 each" it is reffering to one of each court tower regardless of which towers you currently have. AOS adds 1 additional cost to each (X) each price.

### (X) Red/Black

When text calls for red or black cards, you cannot use the action unless you have those cards in that color. For example, if you want to use the ability **Luck** when in a black-colored court, you can spend 1Â each if every card is black. If any of the cards are red, you cannot use the ability. The same goes for actions that call for red cards.

### Devour

An action that calls for devour X tower requires a full tower to be placed under the corresponding court card until the court card is discarded.

### Attack Dice

Attack dice equal the boistered checkers under a chess piece. Success is usually a roll of 5-6. The success can be modified by various actions and events.

### Unpawns

Unpawns are the dark versions of pawns that can be created through certain court actions. They function exactly the same as pawns but are not affected by pawn-specific moves such as the king card's **Knight** ability.
