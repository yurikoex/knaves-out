## Terms

### Adjacent

Two pieces on the board(s) with touching squares.

### Tower

An area above any of the court cards in which a player places cards face up in order from lowest to highest(aces low). These cards are the currency in which actions are paid. These cards must be discarded when spent.

### (X) Cards

When text says "2 Cards" it is referring to the current court card's tower. For example, if the Knave has A, 2, and 3 as its cards in play, then it discards the 3 and 2 card to pay the cost of the desired action.

### Devour

An action that calls for devour X tower requires a full tower to be placed under the corresponding court card until the court card is discarded.

### Frenzied

A frenzied pawn gets to attack attackers first, move 1 square, and gets 1 extra attack die.

### Ace of Spades

This special court card can only be played under special circumstances. It can be played in the J, Q, and K towers, but it is in play as a normal ace.

This card unlocks the [Almighty](/rules/?id=almighty) and [Gather 3 Ancient Relics](/rules/?id=gather-3-ancient-relics) endings.

You can only place it as a court card if used in an action (see specifics on the actions that use this card below.)

#### Motorhead

This variation of AOS speeds up the player.

You can play 2 actions each turn, but wreckless abandon causes all pawns and buildings to be hit on a 3-6 die roll.

#### Ice Queen

This variation of AOS makes the realm a frozen wasteland.

Buildings must be hit twice an attack to take damage.

### Attack Dice

Attack dice equal the boistered checkers under a chess piece. Success is usually a roll of 5-6. The success can be modified by various actions and events.
