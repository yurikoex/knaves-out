## Courts

A court consists of a Knave(Jack), a Queen, and a King card. Depending on the combination of the court, different allowable actions are available to the player and the main strategy of Knaves Out.

### Knave

Knaves are the founding fathers of kingdoms. They are the first to power, then they gather and build everything around them more and more. When building a court, a player can only place a jack card face up as their first card. This becomes the foundation to the first tower.
