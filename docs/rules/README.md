# Rules

## Setup

1. Each player must have a copy of all 4 games and have all game pieces accounted for before playing. Each player is encouraged to bring unique pieces to the game to help distinguish players and to show off their personalities.
2. All players roll all 5 dice. Highest total goes first. Ties need to be settled between the tied players however they decide.
3. To create the world of Dominatri, each player begins to place a Checkers/Chess board on the table, clockwise unless south of the equator. If in space or on a planetary body other than Earth, always go counter clockwise.
4. As players place each board, at least 3 squares must be adjacent to another board(s) already placed on the table.

![Setup](../_media/board_constraints.png 'Align boards to allow 3 squares to touch')

![Setup](../_media/world_setup.png 'Example 8 player world of Dominatri.')

5. Players continue to place the white king building with 4 black checkers under it.
6. Each player should shuffle their personal deck of cards.
7. Player with highest roll takes the first turn.

## Turn

Each player takes a turn following the same order described in setup.

### Basic Rules of a Turn

1. Shuffle discard with deck if desired.
2. Draw up to 10 cards in hand.
3. Take any of the following 4 steps in any order.
   - Play any cards from hand face up on towers.
   - Take 1 allowed action
   - Move any number of pawns/unpawns
   - Attack
4. If over 10 cards in hand, discard extra cards.
5. If 10 cards in hand and no cards played this turn, you may discard hand.

## Courts

There are 3 towers of cards on the table in front of each player. Each tower is built on court cards. The basics of building towers is selecting a court to rule the kingdom. A court consists of a Knave(Jack), a Queen, and a King card. Depending on the combination of the court, different allowable actions are available to the player and the main strategy of Knaves Out.

There is also a fourth tower that is unlockable through certain court actions. This tower is built upon the Ace of Spades, and works as a normal tower would. More information on the Ace of Spades can be found later on in the rules.

![Setup](../_media/towers.png 'Typical layout')

> Play area layout along with the AOS tower.

### Knave

Knaves are the founding fathers of kingdoms. They are the first to power, then they gather and build everything around them more and more. When building a court, a player can only place a jack card face up as their first card. This becomes the foundation to the first tower.

**NOTE**: Knaves have no way to be replaced as the game progresses, unlike Kings/Queens. Choose your Knave suite/color very carefully!

#### Basic Knave Actions

### Court Type

After all 3 court cards are placed, the court acquires a _court type_ depending on the makeup of the court's suite and/or color.

#### Light Courts

The Light Courts represent all that is good and holy in the world. Not all Light Courts are as pure as the others, but they are still untainted by dark magics and evil spirits.

The Light Courts use the Red card typing, so to use another Light Court's actions you must spend only red cards.

## Playing Cards

As players are allowed to place cards face up, they must place them in order A, 2-10, J, Q, K, above each of the corresponding court cards and/or the Ace of Spades.

### Special Cards

Some cards have unique properties unlike ordinary and Court cards.

#### Joker Card

Play this card to search the deck for any card that can be played and play it. Leave the Joker card under the card.

If the joker is under a court card, the card is now tainted.

Tainted Effects:

| Card  | Effect                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Knave | **All Hail** Costs 3                                                                                               |
| Knave | **Build** All new buildings are now tainted                                                                        |
| Queen | **Poison** Roll 6 sided die, rolling 1 causes king to switch the cup, queen dies                                   |
| Queen | **Charm** Roll 6 sided die, rolling 1 causes pawn to not move but die, resurrect as an unpawn, and gain 1 checker. |
| King  | **Knight** Costs 3                                                                                                 |
| King  | _Evil King_ - Makes any unpawn succesfully attack with a die roll of 4-6                                           |

#### Ace of Spades

This special court card can only be played under special circumstances. It can be played in the J, Q, and K towers, but it is in play as a normal ace.

This card unlocks the [Almighty](/rules/?id=almighty) and [Gather 3 Ancient Relics](/rules/?id=gather-3-ancient-relics) endings.

You can only place it as a court card if used in an action (see specifics on the actions that use this card below).

There are two variations of this card obtained from certain courts, Ice Queen and Motorhead.

##### Motorhead

This variation of AOS speeds up the player.

You can play 2 actions each turn, but wreckless abandon causes all pawns/unpawns and buildings to be hit on a 3-6 die roll.

##### Ice Queen

This variation of AOS makes the realm a frozen wasteland.

Buildings must be hit twice an attack to take damage.

## Movement

Pawns can move any direction. They can move a number of spaces equal to the checkers under them plus one.

A pawn can go to sea for the cost of 1 checker. It can move to the sea in 1 movement, but cannot return to land until next turn.

When a pawn returns to land, they can choose any space on the map next to the sea.

## Pawns

Pawns are the soldiers of the kingdom. Each pawn represents a collection of military might that a kingdom owns.

A pawn can attack other adjacent or diagonal chess pieces on the board(s), including their own if you desired.

![Setup](../_media/attacking.png 'Chess pieces must touch to attack.')

> Chess pieces must touch to attack. 1 and 2 can attack each other but 3 cannot.

Each pawn can attack with 1 die at a time. To successfully attack a pawn must roll 5-6 on a six sided die.

A pawn can be boistered with various ways in the game. When boistered, a pawn could have up to 4 checker pieces under it.

Each checker gives the pawn +1 extra attack dice up to a max of 5 attack dice.

A pawn can move 1 space per turn in any direction, adjacent or diagonal.

Each checker gives the pawn +1 extra space it can move per turn.

If a pawn dies, remove it from the board.

You can never have more than 8 black pawns (unpawns) and 8 white pawns (pawns) in play at once.

### Unpawns

Unpawns are the undead monstrosities born from the church's dark magic. These vile creatures are just as powerful as a pawn is, and follow all the same basic rules as a pawn would (such as movement, the pawn rules listed above, the checker rules below, ect.), but aren't affected by pawn-specific moves.

## Checkers and Boistering

Checkers are used as indicators to show that a chess piece has been boistered (or improved)

A checker under a pawn means it has an extra damage dice, and extra movement, and an extra hit point.

A checker under a building means it has an extra hit point

Black checkers for buildings, max 12 deployed.

Red checkers for pawns, max 12 deployed.

## Building

There are eight buildings. Each building can take 1 damage before being destroyed. If a building is destroyed, remove it from the board.

When a building is built, it must be placed next to an existing building, adjacent or diagonal.

A building may only have a max of 4 checkers.

### Tainted Building

This building has been tainted by the corruption of humans or the unholy.

All pawns act as 1 less their strength next to a tainted building. Minimum strength of 1.

All unpawns spawned next to a tainted building gain an extra checker.

#### Rooks

A rook building is the barracks of the kingdom. It can train and produce troops.

If two rook buildings are in play, pawns produced by **Train** start with a checker.

[filename](../actions/rooks.md ':include')

#### Knights

Knight buildings are the defense of the kingdom. They typically protect the King building, using the terrain to their advantage.

If two knight buildings are in play, They attack with +1 die (max of 5 dice).

[filename](../actions/knights.md ':include')

#### Bishop

Bishop buildings are the guiding holy light of the kingdom. They inspire hope in the darkest of days.

If two bishop buildings are in play, you need a perfect 6 die roll to hit their **Blessing** targets.

[filename](../actions/bishops.md ':include')

## Winning

### Last Man Standing

If all other players are defeated and you are alive, you win.

### Gather 3 Ancient Relics

Players can quest to gather the 3 ancient relics scattered across the map.

When at a relic location, attack the darkness, if the attack is successful, the relic is acquired.

When you collect the first relic, your Knave tower crumbles and turns to dust. The second relic's collection causes the Queen tower to crumble into dust. The final relic does not destroy a tower, as you win!

Relic Locations:

- Farthest corner of a board away from your king building.
- Closest empty red square to the closest enemy king building.
- At sea.

### Almighty

If every card is in play, (including the AOS and its tower) you win!

## Defeat

If your king building is destroyed, you are defeated.

## Advanced / Alternate Rules

### Starting with a court

If your group decides to use this rule, start the game with a Knave, Queen, and King already in play. You can optionally have the Joker cards in play under any of the court cards.

### Add fuel to the fire

If you wish, add A-3 to each tower to get right into the action!
